## Introduction to RNA Prediction

RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) is a vital molecule involved in various biological processes, including gene expression, regulation, and protein synthesis.

## Getting Started

Before you dive into RNA prediction and modification, make sure you have a clear understanding of the prerequisites and installation steps.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this project, you'll need:

- Basic understanding of molecular biology concepts.
- Familiarity with programming and command-line tools (ie. Powershell).
- A code editor (Intellij or Visual Studio) for viewing and editing scripts.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using: https://github.com/shashivish/RNA-ModX.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: RNAModXApp
3. Install the required libraries and dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the command: streamlit run main.py

## Example

1. The UI looks like this: ![UI](RNAModXApp/images/ui-original.png)
